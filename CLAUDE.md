# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Self-hosted website analytics, single-operator. Tracks page views, clicks, scrolls, sessions, and custom events. Properties (tracked sites) embed a collector script that POSTs JSON to `/collect`. The dashboard renders metric cards, time-series charts, world map, and PDF/markdown reports for any date range.

Single-binary axum app, no Django, no multi-user. Password from `.env`. Originally a Django service; data from that era was migrated in via `./analytics migrate <django.sqlite3>` and the Django code has been retired.

## Commands

- **Dev server:** `make run` (runs Vite watch + cargo run concurrently on port 8000)
- **Production build:** `make build` (Vite assets + topojson maps + release binary)
- **Run release binary:** `make start`
- **Pull production data:** `make pull` (rsync db + geoip from `git remote server`)
- **Rebuild map data:** `make maps` (regenerates per-country topojson)
- **Seed fake data:** `make seed` (creates/refreshes a "Seed Test" property with realistic events; override `SESSIONS=2000 DAYS=60`)
- **Import a Django DB:** `make migrate FROM=<path-to-django.sqlite3> [FORCE=1]` — one-shot import that preserves property UUIDs (so embedded snippets keep working). Same logic is exposed on the binary as `./analytics migrate <path> [--force]` so the production Docker image can run it.
- **Docker build:** `sudo docker build .`

There are no tests or linters configured.

## Architecture

**Backend:** Single-binary axum app (`src/main.rs`). Async sqlx + sqlite (WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `busy_timeout=5s`, foreign keys on) for both reads and writes. Schema lives in `migrations/0001_initial.sql` and is applied automatically on boot. State is shared via `AppState` (template env, db pool, cookie key, geoip + ua parsers, dashboard cache, config).

**Auth:** Single password from `ANALYTICS_PASSWORD` in `.env`. Login form posts to `/login`; on success a signed cookie (`SameSite=Strict`, 30-day max-age) is set. The cookie payload is just `1:<exp-timestamp>`, signed with `tower-cookies`. The cookie key is `ANALYTICS_COOKIE_SECRET` if set, else derived from the password via SHA-512 (so changing the password invalidates sessions). No CSRF tokens — `SameSite=Strict` is the protection.

**Data model:** Three tables. `properties` holds tracked sites (UUID PK, name, custom_cards JSON, is_protected, is_public). `events` stores human events with hot fields extracted into typed columns (url, referrer, user_agent, country, region, city, lat/lon, screen size, platform/browser/device, utm_*, time_on_page_ms, user_id) plus an `extra` JSON blob for custom keys. `bot_events` is a separate table with the small subset of fields useful for bot reporting; bot traffic is routed there at write time so human dashboard queries never have to filter it. `meta` is a key-value table for things like the Proprium property id.

**Collector flow:** `POST /collect` (also `/collect/` for compat) accepts `{collectorId, event, data}` JSON. It looks up the property, normalizes the referrer to a bare hostname, runs GeoIP enrichment (via `maxminddb` against `data/db.mmdb`) on `session_start`, parses the user agent (via `uaparser` against `data/regexes.yaml`), and either inserts into `events` or `bot_events` based on the parsed bot flag. CORS is fully open on this endpoint. Client IP is read from `X-Forwarded-For` first, then `X-Real-IP`.

**Self-tracking (Proprium):** On first boot the binary auto-creates a "Proprium" property with `is_protected=1` and stores its UUID in the `meta` table. The base template renders a collector snippet pointing at that property when `BASE_URL` is set, so the app tracks its own usage like any other site.

**Auto-downloads:** On boot, two best-effort background tasks download `data/db.mmdb` (DB-IP City Lite, CC-BY-4.0, no signup) if missing or older than 30 days, and `data/regexes.yaml` (canonical ua-parser regexes from the `ua-parser/uap-core` repo, Apache-2.0) if missing. Failures are logged and the server still boots — UA parsing falls back to a substring heuristic and GeoIP enrichment is skipped.

**Templates:** Jinja2 templates in `templates/` rendered by minijinja with a Jinja2-faithful HTML formatter so `/` is not escaped to `&#x2f;` (matches blog/darkfurrow). The `vite_asset` global resolves hashed asset names by reading `dist/.vite/manifest.json` — re-read per call in debug builds (Vite watcher rebuilds show up immediately), cached at startup in release builds.

**Frontend pipeline:** Vite (run from `frontend/`) builds `frontend/static_src/` into `dist/`. Four entry points: `base` (Bootstrap 5 SCSS + monaspace font + the bootstrap JS shell), `pages` (marketing pages), `properties` (dashboard charts + map), `collector` (the public embed script). Output filenames are content-hashed and served at `/static/`.

**Map data:** `frontend/scripts/build_maps.js` (run at Docker build time via `bun run build:maps`) downloads Natural Earth admin-0 110m + admin-1 10m GeoJSON and writes per-country TopoJSON files into `static_maps/`. The Rust binary serves that directory at `/static_maps/`. The world view ships with the dashboard; per-country admin-1 is lazy-fetched on click.

**Dashboard cache:** `moka` in-memory cache keyed by `dash:<property>:<updated_at>:<dates>:<filter_url>`, 5-minute TTL. `?report=pdf|md` bypasses the cache so exports match the live view.

**PDF generation:** `src/pdf.rs` spawns chrome-headless-shell via `--print-to-pdf` against a temp `.html` file. Chromium is located via `CHROMIUM_BIN`, then PATH search, then a `/opt/playwright-browsers/` glob fallback (lifted directly from blog/darkfurrow).

**Request logging:** `src/main.rs::log_requests` middleware prints `time METHOD STATUS latency path` per request with ANSI-colored status codes (green 2xx, cyan 3xx, yellow 4xx, red 5xx). Sub-microsecond cost.

```

The binary reads `templates/`, `dist/`, `migrations/`, and `static_maps/` from cwd by default. Override the project root with `ANALYTICS_ROOT=<path>` and the data directory with `ANALYTICS_DATA_DIR=<path>` (production sets the latter to `/data`).

## Key Routes

- `/` — marketing home (redirects to `/properties` when authenticated)
- `/login`, `/logout` — single-password auth
- `/properties` — list + create + delete + custom cards + visibility toggle (auth required)
- `/<property-id>` — dashboard (auth required unless property is public). Accepts `?date_start`, `?date_end`, `?date_range`, `?filter_url`, `?report=pdf|md`.
- `/collect`, `/collect/` — public collector endpoint (CORS-open, accepts JSON POST)
- `/changelog`, `/documentation`, `/favicon.ico`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` — static pages
- `/static/*` — Vite assets (1y cache header)
- `/static_maps/*` — topojson per country (1y cache header)

## Tooling

- **Rust deps:** managed with `cargo` (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`)
- **JS deps:** managed with `bun`, run from `frontend/` (`frontend/package.json`, `frontend/bun.lock`)
- **Production:** Docker (`rust:alpine` builder + `alpine:3.23` runtime, `chromium` apk for PDF), deployed via `git push server master` triggering a post-receive hook that runs `docker compose up --build --detach`. Data persisted to `/srv/data/analytics/`.

## Status of the port

The port is feature-complete against the original Django version:

- Login, properties CRUD, dashboard with all 16 metric/chart/list aggregations, custom cards, public toggle, collector with UA + GeoIP enrichment + bot routing, PDF + markdown report export, world map with admin-1 drill-down, self-tracking via Proprium, auto-download of geoip + uaparser regexes, Dockerfile + samplefiles for the standard `git push server master` deploy.
- The dashboard's frontend JS (Chart.js charts, d3-geo + topojson world map, custom-card form, public toggle, filter chips, date selector) is the original code; the server-side context shape matches what those scripts expect.

Possible future work (none of it required for parity):

- Custom-cards POST currently accepts a JSON array but the in-page form uses checkbox names. The form-handler JS posts JSON, so this works; if the JS ever stops sending JSON, the endpoint would need to accept form-encoded too.
- `?report=pdf` template links the production base_url for assets. In dev, leave `BASE_URL` unset and chromium will inline the relative paths.
- Auto-download of the DB-IP mmdb fails on the first day or two of every month while DB-IP rolls the new file. The code retries on next boot — for production set up `restic-status`-style monthly cron via `make pull` if you need stronger guarantees.
